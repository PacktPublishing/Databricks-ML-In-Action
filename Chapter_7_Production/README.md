# Chapter 7: Productionizing Machine Learning

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**
1. Registering your model in the UC Model Registry
2. Deploying your model - Inference & Serving
3. Automating the ML Lifecycle
4. Applying our learning

## Links in the chapter:**
- [MLFLow Model Registry Webhooks on Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/mlflow/model-registry-webhooks.html)

## Technical requirements 
- [On-demand features require the use of DBR ML 13.1 or higher.
- [Python UDFs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/udf/unity-catalog.html) are created and governed in UC; hence, Unity Catalog must be enabled for the workspace.
