### What do you need to run the examples?

You will need a Databricks environment and permissions to run a cluster in order to follow along. There is a [Databricks community Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/community-edition.html) that you can use to run the provided notebooks and code. However, we do use Unity Catalog which is available only on paid versions so some features will not work.


### Disclaimer

The authors will do its best to keep the code and examples provided as up-to-date as possible, but we understand that you may encounter outdated snippets or other issues. Please post your enquiries in the [issues page](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Databricks-Lakehouse-ML-In-Action/issues) should you require further assistance.
